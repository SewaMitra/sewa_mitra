// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

  testWidgets('App load smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    // Note: Since Firebase.initializeApp() is called in main(), 
    // a pure widget test of SewaMitraApp might need a mock, but let's at least fix the syntax/imports.
